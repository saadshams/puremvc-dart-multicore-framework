import 'package:puremvc/puremvc.dart';

/// A base [INotification] implementation.
///
/// PureMVC does not rely on underlying event models such as the one provided
/// with Flash, and Dart does not have an inherent event model.
///
/// The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists to support
/// event-driven communication between the application and the actors of the
/// MVC triad.
///
/// Notifications are not meant to replace platform-native events. Generally,
/// [IMediator] implementors attach event listeners to their view components,
/// handle those events as usual, and then may broadcast [Notification]s to
/// trigger [ICommand]s or communicate with other [IMediator]s. [IProxy] and
/// [ICommand] instances communicate with each other and with [IMediator]s
/// through [INotification]s.
///
/// A key difference between native events (e.g., Flash's [Event]) and PureMVC
/// [Notification]s is that native events follow the 'Chain of Responsibility'
/// pattern and bubble up the UI hierarchy, while PureMVC [Notification]s follow
/// a 'Publish/Subscribe' pattern. PureMVC classes do not need to be in a
/// parent/child relationship to communicate via [Notification]s.
///
/// See also: [Observer]
